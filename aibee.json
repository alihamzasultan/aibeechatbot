    "response": "Great question! The directions are simple. Just add a small amount of room temperature water to the venom vial and shake until dissolved. Mix the solution with your favorite cream or serum. Bee Venom will readily dissolve in water. If you are considering using oil such as jojoba, castor or coconut oil as a carrier, slightly heat the oil, then add the venom. Bee venom is thermostable and can withstand high and low temperatures. Just make sure the oil is not scalding hot!"

  "bee_venom_collection": {
    "question": "How is Bee Venom collected?",
    "response": "Great question! Our beekeepers use technology that enables them to collect venom without harming us. The beekeepers use a device called a “Bee Whisperer,” that attracts and invites us to sting a glass plate using a mild electrical shock. The glass plate is then removed, and the bee venom is collected in our laboratory. The collected bee venom then goes through a purification process to remove any debris resulting in 99.99% Pure Bee Venom powder."
  },
  "bee_safety": {
    "question": "Do the bees die or get hurt?",
    "response": "We don’t die, and we don’t get hurt. After stinging the glass plate, we return to our beehive and forage flowers the next day."

  "product_expiry": {
    "question": "When do the products expire?",
    "response": "The APIS Bee Venom serums and Ointments will last up to 2 years. Bee Venom powder, if left in a cool environment, will last at least 2 years, and if left at room temperature, will last 1 year. The APIS Bee Venom Spray will only last a couple of months since water is used in its formulation."
